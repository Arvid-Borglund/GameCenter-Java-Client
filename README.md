# GameCenter-Java-Client
This is a project with a Java client consuming the GameCenter webservice that can be seen in other my other repository. 
This app is very similar to my other client projects for the GameCenter web service but with an somewhat less sophisticated error handling, I still have error-handling in the web service tho and error messages are still displayed for the user in the GUI via a proxy method (call). Swing was used for the GUI. 
Things of interest here could be my use of multithreading with the help of a SwingWorker background thread for asynchronous operations.

Please note that Java project 3 is the one that is of relevance here, Java project 4 is a client project for the Microsoft Crouns database.
